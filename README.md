# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project
##  Machine Learning Approach to Stock Price Prediction
This project aims to build a long-short term memory networks model to predict stock price.  
The data set used is historical prices and volumes of all the companies in S&P 500, which is queried from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and is stored in the `data.csv` file.  
The model is built using Keras with Tensorflow backend.  
All the code and result can be found in the `code.ipynb`.  
The project proposal is the `proposal.pdf`, and the final report is the `report.pdf`.  The rmd files with the same names are the rmarkdown files that generate the report.
